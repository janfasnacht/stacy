2,connection timed out – see help r(2) for troubleshooting,General,"connection timed out – see help r(2) for troubleshooting An internet connection has timed out. This can happen when the initial attempt to make a connection over the internet has not succeeded within a certain time limit. You can change the time limit that Stata uses under this condition by typing set timeout1 #seconds. Or, the initial connection was successful, but a subsequent attempt to send or receive data over the internet has timed out."
3,no dataset in use,General,no dataset in use You attempted to perform a command requiring data and have no data in memory.
4,no; dataset in memory has changed since last saved,General,"no; dataset in memory has changed since last saved You attempted to perform a command that would substantively alter or destroy the data, and the data have not been saved, at least since the data were last changed. If you wish to continue anyway, add the clear option to the end of the command. Otherwise, save the data first."
5,not sorted,General,"not sorted master data not sorted using data not sorted The observations of the data are not in the order required. To solve the problem, use sort to sort the data then reissue the command; see [D] sort. In the second and third cases, both the dataset in memory and the dataset on disk must be sorted by the variables specified in the varlist of merge before they can be merged. merge automatically sorts the datasets for you, unless you specify the sorted option. You specified sorted, but your dataset is not sorted on the variables in varlist. Do not specify sorted."
6,Return code from confirm existence when string does not exist.,General,Return code from confirm existence when string does not exist.
7,‘ ’ found where expected,General,‘ ’ found where expected You are using a program that is using the confirm command to verify that what you typed makes sense. The messages indicate what you typed and what the program expected to find instead of what you typed.
9,assertion is false,General,"assertion is false no action taken Return code and message from assert when the assertion is false; see [D] assert. Or, you were using mvencode and requested that Stata change ‘.’ to # in the specified varlist, but # already existed in the varlist, so Stata refused; see [D] mvencode. error — Display generic error message and exit 195"
18,you must start with an empty dataset,General,"you must start with an empty dataset The command (for example, infile) requires that no data be in memory — you must drop all first.

100,varlist required,Syntax/Command,"varlist required = exp required using required by() option required Certain commands require a varlist or another element of the language. The message specifies the required item that was missing from the command you gave. See the command’s syntax diagram.

The first blank is filled in with a variable name, and the second and third blanks are filled in with a storage type (byte, int, long, float, double, str#, or strL). You could specify append’s force option to ignore the mismatch. If the str# type is in the master data, the using variable would then be treated as if it contained ””. If the str# type is in the using data, the using variable would then be treated as if it contained numeric missing value. key variable is strL in using data You have attempted to merge two datasets, but one of the key variables is a strL. The blank is filled in with the variable name. The key variables—the variables on which observations are matched—can be str#, but they cannot be strLs."
107,not possible with numeric variable,Syntax/Command,"not possible with numeric variable You have requested something that is logically impossible with a numeric variable, such as encoding it. Perhaps you meant another variable or typed encode when you meant decode."

You may have mistyped the variable’s name. variables out of order You specified a varlist containing varname1-varname2, yet varname1 occurs after varname2. Reverse the order of the variables if you did not make some other typographical error. Remember, varname1-varname2 is taken by Stata to mean varname1, varname2, and all the variables in dataset order in between. Type describe to see the order of the variables in your dataset. not found in using data You specified a varlist with merge, but the variables on which you wish to merge are not found in the using dataset, so the merge is not possible. ambiguous abbreviation You typed an ambiguous abbreviation for a variable in your data. The abbreviation could refer to more than one variable. Use a nonambiguous abbreviation, or if you intend all the variables implied by the ambiguous abbreviation, append a ‘*’ to the end of the abbreviation."

That is, all commands must be between a program define that begins a program definition and an end that concludes a program definition. The command you typed automatically loaded an ado-file that violates this rule."

To get internet access from within Stata, you will have to contact your network administrator and get the network proxy address and port. Once you have the proxy information, open Stata, and in your Stata menu bar click on Prefs and then General Preferences. Under the Internet Prefs tab, check the box labeled Use HTTP Proxy and fill in the appropriate IP and port settings. If you have to enter a username and password to get internet access, check the box labeled Use HTTP Proxy Authorization and fill in your username and password. If your proxy information is entered into Stata correctly and you are still having troubles updating Stata, make sure that your firewall is caching the Stata website correctly. Sometimes at large corporate sites, there are firewalls and caching proxy servers that can interfere with some of the download operations of Stata. The error 672 in Stata is “server refused to send file”, which can come if the proxy server is caching information locally and not directly forwarding the packets on to our web server.

The first blank is filled in with a variable name, and the second and third blanks with a storage type (byte, int, long, float, double, or str#, or strL). For instance, you might receive the message “variable myvar was str5, now strL to accommodate using data’s values”. This means that myvar is of type str5 in the master dataset and of type strL in the using dataset. (label already defined) Occurs during append or merge. The using dataset has a label definition for one of its variables. A label with the same name exists in the master dataset. Thus you are warned that the label already exists, and the previous definition (the one from the master dataset) is retained.
