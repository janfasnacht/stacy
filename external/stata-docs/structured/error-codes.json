Missing values are filled in for the remaining variables. This message indicates that the dataset may contain more or fewer variables than you expected. ( missing values generated) The command created the indicated number of missing values. Missing values occur when a mathematical operation is performed on a missing value or when a mathematical operation is infeasible.

The first blank is filled in with a variable name, and the second and third blanks with a storage type (byte, int, long, float, double, or str#, or strL). For instance, you might receive the message \u201cvariable myvar was str5, now strL to accommodate using data\u2019s values\u201d. This means that myvar is of type str5 in the master dataset and of type strL in the using dataset. (label already defined) Occurs during append or merge. The using dataset has a label definition for one of its variables. A label with the same name exists in the master dataset. Thus you are warned that the label already exists, and the previous definition (the one from the master dataset) is retained.
