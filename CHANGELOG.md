# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Stata wrappers now verify that the `stacy` binary they invoke is version-compatible (#35). On mismatch, `_stacy_exec` aborts with a clear error and a `stacy_setup, force` hint instead of silently running against a stale binary. The check shells out once per Stata session (cached in `$stacy_version_checked`).

### Fixed

- Stata wrappers failed with `command _stacy_check_version is unrecognized` because the generated `_stacy_compat.ado` defined programs that didn't match its filename and wasn't listed in `stacy.pkg` (#37). Split into one file per program.
- Parallel `stacy run` invocations on scripts that share a basename no longer collide on the log file (#20). Each run writes to a uniquely-named log in the working directory (`<stem>_<pid>_<nanos>_<n>.log`), so build orchestrators like Make `-j` and Snakemake can run same-stemmed scripts from a shared cwd safely. The path is reported in JSON output's `log_file` field.
- Non-UTF-8 characters in Stata log files no longer crash the log parser
- Update check now compares against the running binary version, not a stale cached value
- Cargo upgrade instruction now shows correct crate name (`stacy`, not `stata-cli`)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- `stacy run --timeout <seconds>` to kill long-running scripts
- `[paths]` config section for project-local ado directories in `S_ADO`
- Post-install dependency scanning: warn about missing implicit dependencies after `stacy add` and in `stacy doctor`
- Package naming hints: suggest correct SSC package on 404 (e.g. `labmask` → `labutil`)
- Stata wrappers now expose all CLI flags (`AllowGlobal`, `Trace`, `Timeout`, `Parallel`, `Cache`, etc.)

### Changed

- `stacy init` generates minimal config (no default values the user will delete)
- Dependencies in `stacy.toml` sorted alphabetically
- `stacy init` and `stacy add` show package cache location

### Fixed

- Sync `commands.toml` schema with CLI (missing flags, stale args, missing exit code 6)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- `net:` source type for arbitrary URL packages (`stacy add grc1leg --source net:http://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins/`)
- `local:` source type for vendored/local packages (`stacy add myutils --source local:./lib/myutils/`)
- GitHub fallback: synthesize manifest from repository tree when `.pkg` file is missing
- Post-install hints for packages with known implicit dependencies (reghdfe, ivreghdfe, ppmlhdfe, grstyle, etc.)
- `stacy doctor` now surfaces available updates (reads version check cache)
- `stacy deps` now parses `require` statements as package dependencies (including `cap require` and `capture require`)

### Changed

- Improved SSC error messages: distinguish "package not found" from "mirror gap" from "server unreachable"

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- Fix SSC downloads always failing: use HTTP instead of HTTPS for `fmwww.bc.edu` (the server does not support TLS, causing every `stacy add` from SSC to fall back to the GitHub mirror)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- Fix `net install` from Stata: remove phantom files from `stacy.pkg` that caused r(601)
- Fix `--format stata` output: wrong global prefix, wrong quoting, bare types in syntax
- Fix `stacy init` `--name` option and `stacy task` config section reference
- Fix installation docs command name

### Added

- 24 tests for `--format stata` output and codegen correctness

### Changed

- Regenerate all Stata wrappers with fixes
- Align docs and README with paper framing

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-15

Initial public release.
